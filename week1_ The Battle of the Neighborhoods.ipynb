The problems with these sites is that they are one dimensional. If you want to find out all this information about a city you plan to visit next month, you have to do the hard work. Also, just because a venue is the hottest place to go for a night out does not always mean that the unwitting tourist should just ramble in unprepared. The areas surrounding this new venue might be riddled with crime including muggings, car theft and assault, for example. Approach the venue from any direction other than from the north and you could be putting your life in danger. This is when my idea comes in.\n"

You arrive in Chicago the day the conference starts but you've managed to convince your boss to delay your return by a few days giving you time to explore.\n4. But you know no one in Chicago to show you around to all the top sites and to bring you to the best restaurants.\n5. Also the last time you went to a conference you were mugged and had you passport. money and credit cards stolen so you're now nervous of going somewhere without first researching the venue and the surrounding area.\n6. The conference is next week and you don't have time to do all the research you'd like."
